+ Addition - Adds two numbers
- Subtraction - Subtracts one number from another
* Multiplication - Multiplies one number by another
/ Division - Divides one number by another and gives the results as a floating-point number
// Integer division - Divides one number by another and gives the result as a whole number
% Remainder - Divides one number by another and gives the remainder
** Exponent - Raises a number to a power

Functions of the 'math' module
--------------------------------
acos(x) - Returns the arc cosine of x, in radians
asin(x) - Returns the arc sine of x, in radians
atan(x) - Reutrns the arc tangent of x, in radians
ceil(x) - Returns the smallest integer that is greater than or equal to x
cos(x) - Returns the cosine of x in radians
degrees(x) - Assuming x is an angle in radians, the function returns the angle converted to degrees
exp(x) - Returns e(x)
floor(x) - Returns the largest integer that is less tan or equal to x
hypot(x, y) - Returns the length of a hypotenuse that extends from (0, 0) to (x, y)
log(x) - Returns the natural logarithm of x
log10(x) - Returns the base-10 logarithm of x
radians(x) - Assuming x is an angle in degrees, the function returns the angle converted to radians
