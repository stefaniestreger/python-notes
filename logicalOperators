and
Connects to Boolean expressions into one compound expression. Both subexpressions must be true for the compound expression to be true.

Unary operator (works with only one operand). The operand must be a Boolean expression. Reverses the truth of it's operand.
If applies to an expression that is true, the operator returns false. If applied to an expression that is false, the operator returns true.
